Better Multiplayer is a mod that hopes to improve the multiplayer experience right where its lacking, with everything being configurable!

Features:
- Every feature listed can be toggled on or off by the server host

- Forces everyone who joins to automatically join a team.
-- Team color is selectable based upon config.

- Whenever a player dies during a boss, that player is unable to respawn until the boss has been defeated or every player has been killed.
-- This completely prevents the cheesing method of spacing out your deaths and taking turns respawning to the point where the boss is unable to despawn.

- Witch Doctor now sells Wormhole Potions
-- An easy way to get wormhole potions without relying on fishing and herb farming.

I highly recommend you also get the Team Spectate mod, especially if you enable no respawning during boss fights.

This mod isn't made for singleplayer, so its not advised to use it outside of multiplayer.
